This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving closures and the setTimeout function.  The code in `bug.js` shows a loop that uses setTimeout to log the value of `i` after a delay.  However, due to how closures work in JavaScript, the value of `i` logged is not what's intuitively expected.  The solution in `bugSolution.js` illustrates a way to fix this using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to capture the value of `i` in each iteration.
